Hi mom,

Command line is the baby little brother of programming languages. It is the advanced way to control your programming language using computer. Once you get used to it, you can easliy write the code and feel like you actuall own the hunk of metal. Memorize the command is the best way to catch the command line skill. 

It is also called as terminal. It runs an application called a shell that lets you talk to the computer directly using typed shell commands. We can run the commands in any operating system terminal.

There are different commands for executing relevant functionalities. Some of the major functionalities include "print working directory" to see which directory you are working in. It has the command called "pwd". We can change the directory using command cd.
We can use ls to list the files and folders.For make a directory we can use "md" command.rmdir uses to remove a directory. Also with files we can copy, move,view, stream, remove and find files. Mom, if you are using git we can use command line for initialize new repository, add files commit file to repository,pull the changes, create a branch etc.  The last command for exit from the terminal is "exit". 
I hope mom now you got some idea of command line.:)
